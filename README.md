# dyn_kdtree

Dynamic Kd-Tree:  Euclidean, SO(2), SO(3) and more!
C++ with Python Bindings

The KD-tree implementation is based on [bucket-pr-kdtree](https://github.com/jkflying/bucket-pr-kdtree)

# Why dyn_kdtree?

* Faster than OMPL and simpler than NIGH
* Dynamic: Add points one by one -- Ideal for Motion Planning
* Support Euclidean, SO(2), SO(3) and any combination
* Performant and flexible C++ code based on Eigen.
* Single Header File
* Python Bindings for easy integration
* Extendable with custom spaces!
